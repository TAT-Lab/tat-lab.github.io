    <p>I am a Computational Social Scientist and my work explores the social and ethical implications of race, culture,
      identity, and power at the intersection of AI, mixed-reality and ubiquitous computing. I am particularly
      interested in fairness, accountability, transparency, & ethics (F.A.T.E.) in AI. Holistically, I am working to
      understand how complexities of design techniques, automated systems, and digital media impact, oppress, and engage
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am co-advised by UW HCDE Professors Julie Kientz, PhD and Daniela Rosner, PhD.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship  Program (NSF GRFP).
      Through which, I am empowered to continue my pursuit of knowledge and research in human-centered AI, tackling
      coded bias, and deconstructing systems of oppression.
