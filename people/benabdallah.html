    <p>
      I am a designer, researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Washington, in the department of Human Centered
      Design and Engineering. I work at the intersection of digital fabrication, design research and philosophy. I am 
      interested in ways of knowing through making, and developing tools for creativity that support human-machine 
      collaborations. I am part of the TAT Lab and Machine Agency, as well as the DXARTS SoftLab and Studio Tilt.</p>
    
    <p>
      Prior to attending graduate school, I worked as a writer and conversation designer for Alexa at Amazon. I also 
      worked as a video producer and bilingual writer for various tech organizations in Montr√©al, QC.
