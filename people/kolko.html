        Back in the 1990s, I was one of the first academic researchers involved in the early days of the Internet,
        studying text-based virtual worlds, early messaging platforms and social networks, digital games, and technology
        for international development. As an English professor, I studied how race and gender impacted patterns of
        technology adoption. In 2000, I transitioned from the humanities to engineering (and the UW) to help build more
        inclusive technologies that addressed the needs of more diverse communities. I spent 8 years studying the
        emergence of internet and mobile phone usage in Central Asia, which also propelled me to a range of
        international research that eventually focused on health related tech.

        In 2012 I started a company focused on building affordable medical devices, Shift Labs,
        which went through Y Combinator in 2015, and since then I've started teaching and
        researching about entrepreneurship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shift Labs also emerged from innovation work I did at the UW; in 2006 I helped kickstart the
        academic makerspace movement with my Hackademia project at the University of Washington in 2006,
        which examined non-expert innovation influenced by the maker and hacker communities worldwide.
