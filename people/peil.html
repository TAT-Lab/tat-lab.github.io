      "Burren Peil is a researcher and PhD student in Human Centered Design and Engineering. Their work explores art,
      collaborative reflection, co-design, and embodiment as mechanisms for leaning into difficult but necessary
      sociotechnical conversations about the relationships between affect, culture, design, identities, and systems.
      In practice, they draw from their background in user experience and the comparative history of ideas to
      iteratively prototype experiential learning workshops with a team of interdisciplinary collaborators as
      small-scale community interactions for collaborative rethinking and healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of these workshops is to build community while equipping participants with guidance from critical
      areas of study. This guidance is leveraged for gaining a more meaningful understanding of affect, culture,
      design, identities, and systems in context together to aid participants in learning to navigate their worlds
      with agency while advocating for themselves and their communities. A critical part of this work is employing
      design to facilitate raising critical awareness, sometimes understood as trauma sensitivities, across multi-axes
      of social differences collaboratively. Burren employs qualitative methods to document this process and raise
      insights for equitable structural change within and beyond human-computer interaction."
