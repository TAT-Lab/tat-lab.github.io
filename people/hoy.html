      Josephine (Joey) is a designer, facilitator, sometimes-technologist, and graduate student researcher with the
      Tactile and Tactical (TAT) Design Lab in the Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University
      of Washington. Josephine's work is motivated by a desire to help imagine and engineer emancipatory sociotechnical
      systems, designed and adopted with enthusiastic consent by the individuals and communities who will live with
      them, and with consideration and regard for future generations, non-human life, and our world .
    </p>

    <p>
      Joeyâ€™s current research in infrastructuring for solidarity and radical care draws from participatory design
      traditions, community organizing, and collective imaginings (such as speculative fiction and theatre).
