<h2>Research</h2>
Our projects bring together ethnographic, design, engineering, and critical traditions to offer fresh perspectives on
our digital lives. While some of us trace everyday experiences with digital infrastructures to speculate on
equity-driven technology developments; others of us develop new digital tools to inquire into the social and political
lives that technology cultures tend to hide.
